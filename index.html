							<p>Hello! My name is Victor Ibarra-Martinez. As of spring 2026, I am a senior at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. I expect to graduate from
								GMU in May 2027 with a Bachelors of Science in Astronomy.
								<br><br>
								I've had many doubts about my future as I progressed in college. Upon graduating high school in 2019, I decided that I would study computer science
								because it was "in". Having a comp sci degree back then meant I would have been guaranteed a well-paying job. That's what I believed, so I went with
								it, but my gut feeling told me something different. Even though I liked the idea of computer science, I didn't necessarily enjoy solely learning about
								computers in my free time. It didn't fulfill me. I always preferred to be under the stars with my telescope and camera. Still, I continued to pursue
								a comp sci degree at a small community college in my hometown. I achieved my Associate's of Science in Comp Sci with a B average. I had always been
								a straight A student in high school, but I wasn't upset with a B, considering I didn't like computer science all that much.
								<br><br>
								It wasn't all that exciting graduating with this degree, as there was no official graduation and it wasn't what I really wanted to do for the rest of my
								life. Fast forward a year, and I arrive at GMU. I come to find out there is an astronomy program here. Not even a few months in, and I request a change
								of program. I am now officially an astronomy student. Surprisingly, many of the doubts I had in college began at this point, despite how certain
								I was of going into astronomy. I doubted whether an astronomy degree would pay well, whether I should have stuck with CS, what usefulness I would get out
								of my classes, and the list goes on. 
								<br><br>
								Now that I am in my final year of college, I can say for certain I am happy I switched over to physics and astronomy.
								I am grateful to CS for having pushed me through my early years in college, because without it I wouldn't have a solid foundation for computational physics.
								Without CS, I also wouldn't have published this website. I mostly did it because I wanted to display my coding projects, which truthfully, I never got around
								to finishing. At present, I have found a way to incorporate astronomy/physics into coding. I now feel fulfillment working on simulations of physical
								phenomena because I can improve my problem-solving, work on something meaningful, and even see the results of my work at the end. To me, this is what it means
								to do something fulfilling.
								<br><br>
								Having said all that, I hope you find my projects at least somewhat interesting. A new project I am currently working on relates to image processing,
								specifically when it comes to atmospheric turbulence, the optical path of a telescope, and photon noise on the detector at the end of a telescope. I should
								be done with this one by the end of May.

						<article id="2dflow">
							<h2 class="major">Ideal 2D Flow</h2>
							<p>
									This project is a combination of several mathematical and physical principles. It involves the mathematics of partial differentiation, linear algebra,
								matrix multiplication, and vector components. The physical principles involve velocity derivations from the contour of the 2D plot. Ideal flow means
								a fluid has constant density, no viscosity/friction, and no vorticity except at singularities. Thus, the physical principles are based in fluid dynamics.
								I created several scenarios of 2D flow, each of a different 2-D function.
								<br><br>
								<h3 class="minor">My Computational Workflow</h3>
								<u>Step 1:</u> Before doing anything with coding, I like to lay down the foundations of my calculations on paper. By using pencil and paper, it is much easier
								to visualize a plan. This plan must be as explicit as possible to get my code to work without error. All formulas and physical principles must be numerically 
								adapted to carry out thousands, millions, and possibly billions of calculations. This step is comparable to the fun comp sci 101 icebreaker: "Make a peanut 
								butter and jelly sandwich". Every line of code must be explicitly stated to handle every step.
								<br>
								<u>Step 2:</u> After planning is (sort of) complete, I begin coding. I create the groundwork first, starting with any necessary libraries, making my grid, and defining
								the functions I will need. I like my functions to be simple, yet effective, so I assign each of my functions one task. I do not mind writing many functions,
								as long as each of them excel in doing what I want them to. This makes my code much easier to read, and if any errors arise, I can easily track where they
								originated.
								<br>
								<u>Step 3:</u> The final steps of my coding process include creating the final arrays and matrices of calculations, then plotting those arrays and matrices. Matplotlib
								is my best friend because it knows exactly what I want 99% of the time. The other 1%, it pushes me to figure out what I want.
								
								$$ { \psi(x,y) = 2Axy } $$
								The above formula is the first formula I modeled for the ideal 2D flow project.
								$$ { \psi(x,y) = \frac{\Gamma}{2\pi}*ln{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} } $$
								Above is the second 2-d formula.
								$$ { \psi(x,y) = Uy + \frac{m}{2\pi}\arctan{\frac{y}{x}} } $$
								Above is the third.
								<br><br>
								The above three formulas plot each of the three 2-D surfaces over which I calculated the vector velocity flow. As for the vector velocity
								flow, the vector was characterized by:
								$$ { \vec{U} = u\hat{i} + v\hat{j} = \frac{d\psi(x,y)}{dy} - \frac{d\psi(x,y)}{dx} } $$
								After confirming the nature of the formulae, I created a function U in python: <code>def U(psi, x, y, C1=1, C2=1)</code>. This function calculates 
								$$ { \vec{U} = u\hat{i} + v\hat{j} } $$ vectors for each x and y on the grid I created, for the given psi function in the first parameter. Because each vector
								component was a partial derivative, I calculated the partial derivative of psi(x,y) with respect to y for the i component, and with respect to x for the j 
								component, using the central difference approximation method of differentiation. I saved the vector's (i,j) components as a tuple in each (x,y) coordinate, 
								so the final form of the resulting array was A[x][y][0 or 1], for the x or y component of the (x,y) value of A. With this, I was able to plot all the vectors
								to create a vector field with <code>def plotfield(U, psi, x, y, C1=1, C2=1).</code> This was the trickiest part of the program, as I used meshgrid to save the
								arrays of (x,y) pairs to X and Y matrices.
								<br><br>
								Below are the plots of the three 2-D functions, each titled and captioned according to its respective function:
